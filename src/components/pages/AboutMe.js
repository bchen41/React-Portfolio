            My name is Betty Chen and I was born in Manhattan, NY, but spent
            most of my childhood in Buffalo, NY. After a couple of years, my
            family moved to Ridgewood, NJ, where I stayed until I graduated from
            high school. I then graduated from UCONN with a bachelor's in
            Molecular and Cell Biology. After that, I worked in a pharmaceutical
            industry for one year and then a chemical laboratory for two years.
            I am now learning how to be a web developer through Rutgers Coding
            Bootcamp.
