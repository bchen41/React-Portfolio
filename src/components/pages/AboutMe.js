                My name is Betty Chen and I was born in Manhattan, NY, but spent
                most of my childhood in Buffalo, NY. After a couple of years, my
                family moved to Ridgewood, NJ, where I stayed until I graduated
                from high school. I then graduated from UCONN with a bachelor's
                in Molecular and Cell Biology. After that, I worked in a
                pharmaceutical industry for one year and then a chemical
                laboratory for two years. I am now learning how to be a web
                developer through Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

                to music, and dancing. My number one favorite band is BTS ðŸ’œ.
