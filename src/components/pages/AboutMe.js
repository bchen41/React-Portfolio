                I am a Full Stack Developer with a bachelor's degree in
                Molecular and Cell Biology from University of Connecticut. I
                have experience in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry as
                an analytical technician. I have taken the opportunity during
                the pandemic to pivot my career path towards software
                engineering. I underwent a challenging 3-month Full Stack Web
                Development program through the Rutgers University Coding
                Bootcamp, with newly developed skills using MongoDB, Express.js,
                Node.js, React.js., RESTful APIs and creating
                responsive/polished UI web design.

                I enjoy eating all kinds of foods, such as Korean BBQ and sushi.
                watching shows, reading webtoons, baking, and listening to
                music. My favorite band is BTS ðŸ’œ.
